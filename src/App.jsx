              a.m. Neighborhood borders are from the NYC Department of City
              Planning. To calculate turnout by Neighborhood Tabulation Area
              (NTA), we merged election district geographies from both the 2018
              and 2022 elections with the 2020 NTA shapefile. In cases where
              election districts fell within more than one NTA we counted it as
              being part of the NTA that included its largest area.
